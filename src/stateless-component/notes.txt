component vs state
stateless components need not be interactive
statefull components while building elemnets that accepts user inputs
are elements that are interactive on page
fetching data using rendering- dependent on state while rendering
(dependent on data that can't be passed down as props)

stateless will not have knowledge of past, current or possible future state change while state will contain the knowledge of past present and future state changes

calculates state of the internal state of the components
statefull will have state knowledge of core components

stateless- provides referential transparency.
staefull- receive info from the stateless componentsif state needs to be changed

all function components can be considered as stateless components
all class based are statefull

Stateful react components inherits the class based components - states get inherited.
